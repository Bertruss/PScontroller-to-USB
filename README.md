# PScontroller-to-USB
Adapt a Sony Playstation controller (all-digital variants, such as scph-1010) to USB
currently, treats the dpad as 4 discreet buttons, also maps to an xy analog axis(using 1 0 -1 values) as some applications looks for the dpad as such. there is also some commented out code for mapping to a "hat switch", as an XBOX control pad would.
