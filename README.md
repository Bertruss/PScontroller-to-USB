# PScontroller-to-USB
Adapt a Sony Playstation controller (all-digital variants, such as scph-1010) to USB

Currently, treats the dpad as 4 discrete buttons, and also maps to an xy analog axis as some applications look for the dpad as such. 
There is also some commented out code for mapping to a "hat switch", as an XBOX control pad would.
